\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mac OS X does not allow mice or keyboards to be controlled by more than one driver at a time. When SteerMouse is installed, it will take control of most Logitech mice and keyboards, thereby preventing LCC from detecting them. The exception is Logitech mice and keyboards that support the Unifying feature, as these devices can be seen by LCC even when SteerMouse is installed. If you want to use LCC to configure other Logitech mice and keyboards, you will need to uninstall SteerMouse.}
